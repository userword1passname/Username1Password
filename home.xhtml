                Stabilization is my emphasis presently.
                I&#8217;m trying to keep better track of time and its changes.
                I&#8217;m also getting into archiving, which helps me with the overcoming of the fear I had for a while with deplatforming.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                My choice of content to share is slowly yielding to openness, rather than hiding.
                I have some very, very controversial ideas, and for many years I was nervous about what I&#8217;ve lately learned is called, as I said,
                &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplatforming" target="_blank">deplatforming.</a>&#8221;
                The online hosting I&#8217;ve found so far has actually been very tolerant, but some of my stories are difficult for me to trust that tolerance in relation to.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                But here I am, with <span style="font-weight: bold">Username1Password!</span> as my Jainist project, <span style="font-size: small">&#2309;&#2327;&#2381;&#2344;&#2367;</span> (<span style="font-style: italic">Agni</span>), or sometimes <span style="font-size: small">&#2309;&#2327;&#2381;&#2344;&#2367;</span> Marshall, being the name I&#8217;m working with wherever the context is trans-Jainist (creator-god emphatic).
                I still plan on working a dokieli blog, but before I go much further with that I want to get better organized between Username1Password! and Agni.

                To me, free and open knowledge, in its promotion of its freedom of utility by anyone for any purpose, allows the utilitarian to proceed according to their own karma, without having to answer to the source of the knowledge.
                I&#8217;ve worked with a number of steps in the direction of personal liberation, my step prior to this one being in connection with the Rosicrucians.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                They have a principle called the <span style="font-style: italic">Law of AMRA</span>, which essentially has social directional reversal with the law of karma.
                Karma means that if you did something to someone, the universe might later find someone who is looking to do something similar, and might then judge that you are the appropriate target for said deed, given that you had behaved likewise previously.
                Now, this can be a good thing or a bad thing, but it has a type of sequence to it.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                AMRA has a quantum level of interpersonal responsibility above karma in its prescription.
                In its polite form, it says that if someone (or if the universe in general) has done something to advantage you, you should then give to others in some way(s) as will perpetuate the interpersonal advantageousness.
                However, as highly virtuous as this is, it has been customarily associated with limitations to simple personal freedom, such freedoms for instance as might appeal to the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a" target="_blank">
                  &#347;rama&#7751;a</a>
                mentality of the Jainist, who seeks to regain self-reliance above some of the more elaborate rules of etiquette amongst theists.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Rosicrucianism may be praised for its ethical and theistic intermediacy between &#347;rama&#7751;ism and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Vedic_religion" target="_blank">
                  br&#257;hma&#7751;ism</a>
                in allowing the human mystic to find their own sense of higher truth, but it applies many peer level rules to the practitioner, such as however a Jainist might yield for the sake of even truer meditation on what virtue is.
                I think this compares to the attribution expected of the carrier of acquired knowledge in modern American (and global) culture, where the origination of the medium and its formal attribution may be likened to the codes of religious worship obeying one of our traditional creator deities.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Virtue is a very real principle that pertains to treating life exactly how life likes to be treated, but the mandates of interpersonal, even cyclical, value carriage and enablement can be a distraction to the more immediate quality of attention used to strengthen truer virtue.
                Elaborative principles are great for a more ceremonial and ritualistic lifestyle, but what, in the given moment, are we actually using anything for?
                That is a very qualitatively important question, and there are still a great many transactions that can be accomplished by those who live their lives simply observing the likes of the laws of karma.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                If you use something the wrong way, life might turn around and treat you wrong in reaction to that negligence.
                If you are, however, using what you have, including what you&#8217;ve acquired, to help your fellows and society, then more likely all will go well.
                Be trustworthy, and thereby trust your own way of doing whatever it is that you have chosen to be doing.

                I have answered to theism for too many years (decades), even lived in fear of peer level for a couple decades after Vi&#7779;&#7751;u restored my sense of His forgiveness.
                Hiding just isn&#8217;t something I feel I need to make too much effort to maintain in my own lifestyle, so I&#8217;m going to let my karma &#8220;work itself out,&#8221; while I give myself more to what genuine qualification is.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                The government doesn&#8217;t need to worry about where I might be working on the Internet lately, if I can stay with this effort.
                My Facebook friends can find me easily enough.
                I&#8217;m just choosing to be as accessible as I can be, even if I do have my own experience with and approach toward a lot of details in life that many would consider to be the business of religion, or psychics, or of some other type of qualified professionalism than I have gone to the exact trouble to prove myself to yet.
